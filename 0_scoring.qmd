## Logistics/Prerequisites

-   Material available/uploaded at https://github.com/louis-olive/teaching_Scoring

-   Email: louis.olive\@gmail.com / louis.olive\@ut-capitole.fr (copy both)

-   Personal or university laptop / Running Rstudio using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) or [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) for reports

-   Basic knowledge of math, statistics / Good command of R

## Agenda

-   Part 1 (9h): Methods

-   Part 2 (15h): Case study / project by group of students

Throughout the course, the emphasis is put on numerical examples with a hands on / code from scratch approach.

Codes are given in R.

## Grading

-   Part 1 (2 Oct, 2h in class + 1 week take home):

In-class data analysis on a real data set including data exploration and applications from the course, followed by a take-home assignment with additional tasks (report + R code, 30%).

-   Part 2:

Realization of (in-class case study + take home reports)\[Part A\] + (project per group of students)\[Part B\] + Final presentation (Part C) (70% = 30% (Part A) + 35% (Part B) + 5% (Part C))

## Agenda - Part 1 (9h): Methods

-   Statistical learning goals and vocabulary are defined in the context of scoring and classification (11 Sep).

-   Introduction and study of two workhorses:

    -   Logistic Regression: model fit, inference, selection, penalization (11/18 Sep)

    -   Decision Trees for Classification / (Gradient) Boosting (25 Sep)

## Agenda - Part 2 (15h): Case study / project by group of students

(groups composition due 9 Oct)

-   Credit risk is one of the various application of scoring.

-   Part A: Case study using a real life data set, you will be given a set of tasks to perform in group (9, 16, 23 Oct, a short report with current code/analysis due for next week class):

    -   Defining the problem / Getting/Cleansing/Enriching Data / Exploration / Baseline model

    -   Testing various feature engineering (implementing ideas from academic literature on credit risk) / Model evaluation pipeline with tidymodels

    -   Advanced topics: "applied" gradient boosting, dealing with imbalance, model (re)calibration, SHAP/PDP

## Agenda - Part 2 (15h): Case study / project by group of students

-   Part B: In parallel a selection of topics will be proposed to the students with the goal to assess alternative methods (projects choice due 16 Oct):

    -   the reading of selected papers,
    -   the understanding of the methods or algorithms at stake (if necessary the students will re-implement from scratch a simplified version or give a short proof of key results),
    -   the implementation of the methods on the real life data set,
    -   the assessment of the method,
    -   the writing of a final report summarizing part A / implementing part B (final discussion 6 Nov, final project reports due 17 Nov 23:59).

-   Part C: A final presentation (group/one-to-one meeting, 20 Nov).
